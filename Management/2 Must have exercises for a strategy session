2 Must have exercises for a strategy session

Creating A Team
---

Before strategizing for a team we must define it.  We have found this can mostly be accomplished with two questions:

 		- What do you want from the team?
 		- What do you expect to contribute to the team?

This can be a very personal question for people so we recommend it isn't done in a group brainstorming session.  We approached this by having each person fill out a planning packet before the session and then copy their answers onto post-it notes during the meeting.  If you don't do a planning packet, you can skip straight to the post-it notes.

Once everyone completes the post-it notes, we go to the whiteboard.  Everyone puts contributions and desires on the board and then we review as a group.  There should be a number of similarites between people in the group and now discussion can begin regarding the differences.  Most importantly, it is now possible to make sure that what the team is expecting is reasonable based on what everyone is giving.  Any items that aren't specifically addressed by the team can be sought out from other sources.

As a manager, it is important to keep the list of wants for everyone in mind.  As people progress in their career they don't quit jobs, they quit managers and teams.  If the team is not providing what the staff member needs their likelyhood of leaving increases.

These lists should be kept rather fluid and reviewed with the team when necessary because these create the basis for team norms.  This can also make recruitment much easier because new members will clearly understand what is expected and what they will recieve for their investment. 


Understanding Competencies
---

This exercise was one that I learned about through the strategic planning course on lynda.com and we felt it was very successful with our group.  I slightly modified this exercise to fit our needs but I wanted to give credit where credit was due.

The exercise is very simple and starts with everyone individually listing their competencies or daily tools on post-it notes.  Preferablly, this is done prior to the 

After everyone takes time to write these down we bin them into three simple groups.

Group A - This is where you have a clear cometitive advantage
	- experience
	- client relationship
	- Strong portfolio piece that shows others your capabilities

Group B - This is where you are equal with your competitors and you don't have a clear way of differentiating yourself.
	- Could go either way

Group C - No clear competitive advantage
	- Lack some skills
	- Don't have a strong portfolio that can effectively communicate your skill set.

Idea is everyone knows what they should be focusing on -> Group A and anything that can be moved in to group A because that is where you can most easily win business and have impact.

At this point, once the team has completed binning we can begin to look forward.

This can be a great jumping point for collaboration and team work because we can now evaluate what is needed to move into group A.  We also know what team members are best positinoed to act as mentors to maximize the chance for success.  From their we can make an value based decision on where to allocate resources.

Now I'm going to turn the presentation over to Casey Perkins who will talk a bit about the OR team projects that helped define our teams' impact.

What we wanted from the team:
	- Mainly this was a sense of belonging and inspiration
	- Wanted to Collaborate
	- Ability to learn new things



	I won't go into much detail here for the sake of time but I'd be happy to answer questions off line or one on one with anyone who is interested.

	as you can see, there are a number of people with R in Group C.
	- From this we can take a few paths
		1) That person shouldn't use R any more
		2) That person want's to improve their R skills so they should collaborate with someone who already has a competitive advantage so they can most rapidly get into Group A.

		From this exercise, we were able to visualize how we can better collaborate as a group and where our team can have the best chances for success.
