2 Must have exercises for a strategy session

Creating A Team
---

Before strategizing for a team we must define it.  We have found this can mostly be accomplished with two questions:

 		- What do you want from the team?
 		- What do you expect to contribute to the team?

This can be a very personal question so we don't recommend doing it in a group brainstorming session.  We approached this exercise by having each person fill out a planning packet before the session and then copy their answers onto post-it notes during the meeting.  If you don't do a planning packet, you can skip straight to the post-it notes.

Once everyone completes the post-it notes, we go to the whiteboard.  Everyone puts contributions and desires on the board and then we review as a group.  There should be a number of similarites between people in the group and now discussion can begin regarding the differences.  Most importantly, it is now possible to make sure team expectations are reasonable based on what everyone is giving.  Any items that aren't specifically addressed by the team can be sought out from other sources.

As a manager, it is important to keep the list of desires for everyone in mind.  As people progress in their career they don't quit jobs, they quit managers and teams.  If the team is not providing what the staff member needs their likelyhood of leaving increases.  By asking team members what they are honestly expecting and desiring you'll be able to better manage retention.

These lists should be kept rather fluid and reviewed with the team when necessary because these create the basis for team norms.  These lists can also make recruitment much easier because new members will clearly understand what is expected and what they will recieve for their investment. 


Understanding Competencies
---

This exercise was one that I learned about through the strategic planning course on lynda.com and we felt it was very successful with our group.  I modified it to fit our needs but wanted to give credit where credit was due.

The exercise is very simple and starts with everyone individually listing their competencies or daily tools on post-it notes.  Preferablly, this is done prior to the strategy meeting.

After everyone takes time to write these down we bin them into three simple groups.

Group A - This is where you have a clear cometitive advantage
	This might come from:
	- experience
	- client relationship
	- Strong portfolio piece that effectively communicates your capabilities with others

Group B - This is where you are equal with your competitors and you don't have a clear way of differentiating yourself.  Perhaps with a bit of work, it would be easy to develop a strong competitive advantage.

Group C - No clear competitive advantage
	- Lack some skills
	- Don't have a strong portfolio that can effectively communicate your skill set.

If possible, it is best to write down what would be necessary to move each of the items into Group A.  This is not easy so often a subset will be taken based on what the individuals actually want to continue doing.  

Clearly the team should be focusing on items in Group A.  These are the things that are the most likely to result in new business and overall impact.  Continuing to focus on items in Group A will ensure your team becomes stronger over time in the areas where they have a competitive advantage.

At this point, once the team has completed binning we can begin to look forward.  If a list was created showing what would be necessary to move into Group A we can start to look for available resources.  If there are others in the group who are already strong in that area, it may make sense to form formal collaborations.  If there are external requirements necessary to move into Group A, their value can now be evaluated based on all other options.  From their we can make a value based decision on where to allocate resources.

This same exercise can be repeated at higher levels in the organization.  Think about the projects and programs that your organization is a part of.  Are you a leader in the field or are these projects simply to pay the bills.  It may seem difficult at first, but by limiting the projects that "pay the bills" you will eventually be able to define a stronger, more cohesive stratgy that will take your organization futher.
