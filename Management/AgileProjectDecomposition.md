# Decomposition of Agile Projects

## Introduction and Background
Traditional project management starts with a project charter, identifies stakeholders, develops a list of requirements, creates a scope and then decomposes all of the activities necessary to complete the overall scope.  This is a useful technique for known projects but it can become combersome and ineffective with software development and research.
Scrum takes an iterative approach of decomposing the scope into Product Backlog Items (PBIs).  These items can easily be rearranged based on the priorites of the project but inevetably some PBIs become duplicated or burried.
Our approach provides as repeatable methodolgy to decompose scope and create a backlog that brings attention to the most important items.  We draw from traditional scrum best practices and expand with a workflow specifically designed to manage the PBIs.

## Stating with the vision

All successful projects need an approachable and comprehensive vision.  Agile is no different.  Vision statements require a high level understanding of the project along that can motivate others.  
Add information on creating a vision from a literature review.


## Creating a Roadmap

This should outline high level attributes of the project and their key delivery dates at a minimum.  When possible, it is ideal to flush out milestones with visions and acceptance criteria so the team can rally behind the larger delivery piece.  Our team uses milestones somewhere between an epic and an overall project.
Milestones are flexible but shouldn't be easy to change in the near term.  We target 4 milestones per year with the first two being within the first 3-4 months of the project.  These first milestones define early goals of the project and facilitate early wins.  The early milestones should only be changed if there is a significant change in the project.  Additional milestones can be added as the project progresses to further narrow down functionality.
Both the roadmap and the vision statement should be owned by the Product Owner.


## Decomposing the Roadmap

### Creating Minimal Requirements Documentation
Starting with the first milestone, start creating requirements documentation to help story decomposition.  These requirements should offer the developers an understanding of the following:
1) Why this specific feature is important?
2) What us required to make this feature successful?
3) An area for questions.
The requirements documentation acts as the header for an epic that will tie together all tasks in that area.  The primary focus is from the user's point of view and does not touch on how the components will actually be built.

### Creating Product Backlog Items
After the requirements are started it is possible to start creating the individual stories and tasks that need to be completed.  Stories and tasks do not have to originate from requrirement documentation and the documentation does not need to be completed before starting stories and tasks.  All story and tasks will end up in the product backlog.
Managing the backlog is the responsibility of the Product Owner but can become onerous.  Different items may be at different levels of refinement and continually rehasing conversations can become time consuming.
Creating order to the PBI funnel can be very powerful to organize the backlog and we have worked using the following stages:

1) Brain dump / needs triage
- very minimally defined high level requirements document.  This could also be a new item
2) Initial refinement
- stage where goal, strategic fit, acceptance criteria are defined.
3) Developer review
- Developers ask questions until the goal, strategic fit, and acceptance criteria are fully defined.  Also, detailed requirements are created.  Includes storypoint estimation.
4) Ready for development
- develop subtasks as appropriate for each item.
5) Relavency review required
- item has been ready for development and not updated for > 30 days.
6) In development
- this is the subsection where a traditional process flow is implemented (to do, in progress, to verify, completed)
7) Awaiting customer approval
- the team has marked it as complete 
8) Completed

[this should be a table showing how each stage relates to different items such as an epic, story, task, bug]
