Social web:

Group outputs:
- white papers
    + These are short research articles that can be written within a few hours
    + Reviewed internally
- Tutorials
    + focused on expanding basic knowledge for others
    + establish credibility and socialize ideas
- Publications
    + Whitepapers could be further refined and peer reviewed to become full publications
- Proposals
    + Similar to white papers but far more conceptual, these show ideas our group has in domain areas.
- Sparks
    + Very simple ideas that are not fleshed out that can be carried further by others
    + A spark is less than 140 characters and may have a targeted area
- Quad Charts
    + A listing of the previous projects that have been completed in a government approved quad chart so others (such as the sector), can understand our past work.
