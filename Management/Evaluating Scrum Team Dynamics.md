#Introduction
Evaluating team performance is critical to creating a highly functional team.  Without evaluations, it is not possible to fully understand where the team is performing well and where improvement can have a material impact on future performace.
Through these evaluation techniques, we aim to gain an understanding of how a team is performing.  It is equally important to understand the quality of the internal team dynamics as well as the outward effectiveness of the final products.
By effectiveness, we mean how well is the team living up to external expectations.  Are the end users happy with the results and is the team adequately managing expectations?
Evaluating internal team dynamics ensures the proper resources are assigned so the team can function at it's highest possible level.  One of the basic principles of scrum states that the team is better than any individual and systematic evaluation of the internal dynamics ensures this is the case.
It is our beliefe that continuous evaluation of the team can serve as valuable fodder for sprint retrospectives and create a longer lasting and better performing team.

Reviews of a scrum team are different form other reviews in that you are measuring a system and not the indivudial, but how do you measure the system without measuring individuals?  Other companies, such as ebay, have instituted evaluation systems where members rate each other in 8 areas.  The aggregate values are used to determine the overall health of the team.  This appears to be a valid methodolgy of measuring the team if done on a routine basis.
It was paramount to keep the ultimate goal in mind at all times.  Our primary goal is to understand where the organization can focus resources to make the team more effective.  This is not about singling out a single person for sensitivity training.
Based on our core goals of evaluating the team, X questions were developed that evaluated the team cohesiveness without evaluating other people.  Each question was designed to answer questions in specific areas and before polling the team, plots and action items were created to show how the data would be used.  Each of the questions had to be forward looking and needed to avoid the ratings bias[ref needed] that dooms so many other performance evaluation systems

Our questions focus in 6 primary areas of teamwork:
0) Alignment
    - As part of this team, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.
    - My skills are used effectively when I work as part of the team.
    - I see myself working with drupal 6 months from now.
    - I believe I am making an impact while working on this team.
    - The organization values my involvement with the team.
    - I have a passion for the work I do as part of the team.
    - I feel energized by the work I am performing with the team.
    - Being part of the team will advance my career at PNNL
1) Communication
    - I feel I have enough background to work on any task on the board
    - I believe I attend the right number of meetings
    - If I have an issue, I feel I can openly discuss it
    - I have given another team member constructive critism
    - Without looking, I can name every member on our team.
2) Cohesiveness
    - I enjoy the time I spend working on team projects
    - I am actively looking for other projects 
    - Our team performs quality work
    - I enjoy working with the team
    - I beleive the team is operating at peak performance
    - A sprint is successful if all of my project deliverables are completed
    - A sprint is successful if all of the deliverables for the projects I work on are completed
    - Everyone on the team contributes equally
3) Learning 
    - I have developed new skill sets in the past month as a part of this team.
    - I am comfortable performing tasks in all areas of development, testing, skinning, and deployment.
4) Direction
    - I understand what is expected from the team
    - I understand what is expected from me
    - I look up to others on the team
    - I am proud to be part of the team
5) Meeting evaluation
    - I gain value from each standup
    - Our team has actionable process improvements after each retrospective
    - I understand all stories and tasks listed in a given sprint
6) Open Questions:
    - What are your suggestions for improving team performace?
    - What questions should have been asked but weren't?
