#Introduction
Evaluating team performance is critical to creating a highly functional team.  Without evaluations, it is impossible to fully understand where the team is performing well and where improvement can have a material impact on future performace.
Through these evaluation techniques, we aim to gain an understanding of how a team is performing.  The internal team dynmacis and outward effectiveness of the outward products are equally important to understand.
By effectiveness, we mean how well is the team living up to external expectations.  Are the end users happy with the results and is the team adequately managing expectations?
Evaluating internal team dynamics ensures the proper resources are assigned so the team can function at it's highest possible level.  One of the basic principles of scrum states that the team is better than any individual and systematic evaluation of the internal dynamics ensures this is the case.
It is our beliefe that continuous evaluation of the team can serve as valuable fodder for sprint retrospectives and create a longer lasting and better performing team.

Reviews of a scrum team are different form other reviews in that you are measuring a system and not the indivudial, but how do you measure the system without measuring individuals?  Other companies, such as ebay, have instituted evaluation systems where members rate each other in 8 areas.  The aggregate values are used to determine the overall health of the team.  This appears to be a valid methodolgy of measuring the team if done on a routine basis.
While developing our rating methodolgy, it was paramount to keep the ultimate goal in mind at all times.  Our primary goal is to understand where the organization can focus resources to make the team more effective.  This is not about singling out someone for sensitivity training.
Based on our core goals of evaluating the team, X questions were developed that evaluated the team cohesiveness without evaluating other people.  Each question was designed to answer questions in specific areas and before polling the team, plots and action items were created to show how the data would be used.  Each of the questions had to be forward looking and needed to avoid the ratings bias[ref needed] that dooms so many other performance evaluation systems

### Overall Team Reviews
Our questions focus in 6 primary areas of teamwork:
0) Alignment
Alignment focuses on how well the work of the team aligns with the individual's career path.  These questions should provide a quantitative indication of the future desire of an individual to work with the team.
    - As part of this team, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.
    - My skills are used effectively when I work as part of the team.
    - I see myself working with drupal 6 months from now.
    - I believe I am making an impact while working on this team.
    - The organization values my involvement with the team.
    - I have a passion for the work I do as part of the team.
    - I feel energized by the work I am performing with the team.
    - Being part of the team will advance my career at PNNL.
1) Communication
Communication is a key aspect of a scrum team.  This group of questions focueses on how well the team is sharing information necessary to perform quality work.
    - I feel I have enough background to work on any task on the board.
    - I believe I attend the right number of meetings.
    - If I have an issue, I feel I can openly discuss it.
    - I have given another team member constructive critism.
2) Cohesiveness
These questions evaluate the strength of the team from an individual's perspective.
    - I enjoy the time I spend working on team projects.
    - I am actively looking for other projects.
    - Our team performs quality work.
    - I enjoy working with the team.
    - Without looking, I can name every member on our team (hint: there are 17 people ont the team).
    - The team is operating at peak performance.
    - A sprint is successful if all of my project deliverables are completed.
    - A sprint is successful if all of the deliverables for the projects I work on are completed.
    - Everyone on the team contributes equally.
3) Learning
Continuous improvement is a core aspect and is measured with these questions.  
    - I have developed new skill sets in the past month as a part of this team.
    - I am comfortable performing tasks in all areas of development, testing, skinning, and deployment.
    - The team has provided professional growth opportunities to me.
4) Direction
    - I understand what is expected from the team.
    - I understand what is expected from me.
    - I look up to others on the team.
    - I am proud to be part of the team.
    - I understand the vision statement of the team.
    - I understand the vision statement for projects where I am a contributor.
5) Meeting evaluation
    - I gain value from each standup.
    - Our team has actionable process improvements after each retrospective.
    - I understand all stories and tasks listed in a given sprint.
    - I leave sprint planning understanding all tasks that need to be performed and I feel empowered to act.
6) Open Questions:
    - What are your suggestions for improving team performace?
    - Where do you believe the team is performing well?
    - What questions should have been asked but weren't?


### Individual Team Member Reviews
The second part of the evaluation focuses on the individual connections between the team.  These are based on the sections put forth by ebay but contain two additoinal areas, team player and connectedness.  These two areas have been added because they are not explicitly called out in any of the other sections.
Given the sensitive nature of this survey, the implementation is important.  Each of the following questions will be a 6 x n team member matrix and therefore will contain a large amount of personal performance data.  It is crucial that this data be anonomized and not shared outside of the team to ensure complete honesty.  The best practice is to have an independent third party download and remove the survey results and then anonomize the data.  Each team member name should be replaced with a random number before the data is analyzed.  Individual team members can then be told their number and be given the data.  This puts the power of sharing in the individuals hands and ensures that any review of the data is complelety anonymus.

#### Team Player:
    - I consider this person to be a team player.
#### Connectedness:
    - I know this person on a personal level.
#### Quality: 
    - When I see this person has taken on a task I know it will be completed correctly and on time. 
#### Ability to Collaborate: 
    - This person actively seeks to collaborate with others on the team
#### Communication: 
    - I am able to get prompt, professional responses quickly.
#### Improvement: 
    - This person invests time to improve their quality and the quality of the team.  I believe this person is contributing to increasing the overall abilities of the team.
#### Role Sharing: 
    - This person is adaptable, able, and willing to take on any type of work on the board
#### Energizing: 
    - When I work with this person I feel empowered to do better work. 
#### Overall Satisfaction: 
    - Given the choice, I would actively try to work with this person in the future.

### External Evaluations
External reviews are important to understand the outward view of the team.

#### Questions
- What is your relationship with the drupal team?
    + client / sponsor, observer, manager, team member
- How long have you been in that role

##### Likert questions from the reviewers point of view
- Given what I know of the team, I wouldn't hesitate to give the team future work
    + If not a 5, why?
- I am proud to show the work the team has performed thus far.
- I understand when the deliverables will be produced.
