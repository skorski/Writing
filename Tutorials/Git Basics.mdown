# Git Basics

Setting it up from the command line

a) set some global variables.  These will save time when making commits because git won't keep asking.  Also, your commits will have the correct name
	i) git config --global user.name
	ii) git config --global user.email

b) If we are going to pull a repo from a remote source
	i) move into the directory of choice
	ii) git clone {sftp:location}

	iii) at this point the entire git directory will be on your machine and you can begin working.
